# Learning System

## Active Recall

### PIPR Learning System

#### Priming

Diagram I – Framework construction via Cornell notes or mind maps<br/>
Overview and Key Concepts – Framework of main ideas via grouping and linking<br/>
Pretesting – Self-testing before the lecture and preparing questions in advance

#### In-Class Notes

Annotated Diagram II – Acquiring a highly valuable content of information on top of Diagram I<br/>
Key Observations – Points of emphasis to be included after prerequisite knowledge is met<br/>
Active Recall Questions – Self-testing questions written for continuous information retrieval

#### Post-Class Immediate Review

Reconstruction – Reordering the relational groupings of active recall questions and Diagram II<br/>
Key Observations Linkage – Linking the key observations to the overarching framework<br/>
ARQ Self-Testing – Self-testing with active recall questions and mending knowledge gaps

#### Revision

Diagram III – Optimized and coherent framework of linked groups and ideas (GRINDE system)<br/>
ARQ Applications – Blurting method, Feynman technique, practice tests and exercises<br/>
Knowledge Retrieval – Spaced repetition, interleaving, optimal breaks via Pomodoro technique

### OK4R Study Method

Overview – Understand the main ideas and the central focus of the study<br/>
Key Ideas – Acquire all important concepts in the material<br/>
Read – Study the material while connecting the concepts with the overview and the key ideas<br/>
Recall – Retrieve knowledge without referencing the source material and assess for correctness<br/>
Relate – Connect the overarching concepts with personal experiences and principles<br/>
Review – Revision of knowledge via spaced repetition and cognitive recall strategies

### CODE Note-Taking System

C – Capture information that is essential and valuable<br/>
O – Organize the information collected<br/>
D – Distill the information into its basic form<br/>
E – Express the information through cognitive processing and active recall

### Self-Testing System

#### Feynman Technique

- Express the ideas in a concise manner
- Apply all learned concepts into a simplified context of instruction
- Identify knowledge gaps and areas for future improvement

#### Blurting Method

- Identify the material to be covered
- Familiarize with the material using the OK4R method
- Retrieve information without referencing to the source material
- Assess responses and revise for corrections
- Reiterate the process until all knowledge gaps are filled

#### Practice Tests

- Attempt to answer in writing without referencing to external notes
- Actively engage with the problem during the first stage of cognitive friction
- Resort to previously made active recall questions if needed
- Reference source material to provide optimal solutions as required
- Assess and explain any incorrect answers during revision

## Spaced Repetition

#### Leitner System

Schedule - Create a spaced retrieval timeline with every consecutive section planned at an extended interval from the prior<br/>
Algorithm - Spaced repetition intervals may be mapped using the base two exponential function<br/>
Classify - Identify which topics and sections are to be covered on the exam and place them in the first section<br/>
Test - Apply active recall via self-testing and move successfully retrieved concepts to the subsequent section<br/>
Reiterate - Repeat the spaced retrieval process for all classified concepts

#### End of Day Review

Revise the material for around twenty minutes at the end of the day

### Revision Timetable Systems

#### Prospective Revision Timetable

- Include all dates available for studying in the first column of a spreadsheet
- Add one-hour intervals to specify study times as needed
- Fill in syllabus topics accordingly using the Leitner System for spaced retrieval

#### Retrospective Revision Timetable

- Include syllabus topics in the first column of a spreadsheet
- Subsequent columns will consist of dates during which topics were last studied
- Highlight the dates on which topical comprehension has been proved sufficient

### Interleaved Practice

- Combine syllabus topics in a varied order of study
- Space out revisions and practice sessions via time blocking and the Pomodoro technique
